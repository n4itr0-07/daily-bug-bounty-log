### **No Hunt Today ~ Just Learning** 📚

Today I focused on learning and nothing else.  
Started the day with InsiderPHD playlist 🎥, watched one video, made notes 📝, then read some articles and cleared my doubts with the help of ChatGPT.  

- JS File Recon talk on NahamCon 2024 by **zseano** 🕸️  
- GraphQL is new PHP by **Lupin** 🧬  
- Got to know about a book on GraphQL named "**Black Hat GraphQL**" 📖  

Resources are attached below. 🔗

### **Lab Setup** 🛠️

Created a **Ubuntu** droplet on **Digital Ocean** ($6).  
First thing I did was install **zsh** and add a few aliases and themes in `~/.zshrc`.  
Initially tried without Docker, but errors everywhere 😩 even ChatGPT got confused lol.  
Then installed Docker and everything worked 🚀

### **Other Tasks** 🔍

- No HTB today because of no time ⏳  
- Opened THM and saw a new room on a new CVE [Erlang/OTP SSH: CVE-2025-32433](https://tryhackme.com/room/erlangotpsshcve202532433) and completed it! ✅  
  *Learned about Erlang and the OTP library of Erlang!*  
> *Also found out today that WhatsApp and Discord use Erlang in their backend! 📞💬*  
- No JS today, wasted time in lab setup ⚙️
