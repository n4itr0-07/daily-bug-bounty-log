# **Day 7 of My Bug Bounty Journey**
---

**السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته** ✨

---

**The whole day went into writing assignments and practicals.** 🥲

---

### ***🪲 Bug Hunting Update***
- No manual or automated hunting today — basically, no recon.
- Learned about *Introspection* in GraphQL (just an overview).
- Honestly, I feel like I’m learning GraphQL as if I were a developer 😂😂

---

### ***🏫 College Update***
- Did not attend classes today.
- Spent the day working on assignments, practical files, and other college stuff.
