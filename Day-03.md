# **Day 3 of My Bug Bounty Journey**

**السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته**

Only 2-3 lectures were scheduled today, so I didn’t attend any of them 😅

## 🎓 **College Study Update**

📚 Mid-terms are coming up in a few days!  
⏳ Just 20 days left for main (external) exams.  
📝 Assignments & practicals pending for all subjects.  
📉 My attendance is dangerously low for 2-3 subjects 🥲

## 😮‍💨 **Burn-out Moment**

I know it’s only Day 3, but I’ve been learning Bug Bounty stuff for the last 2-3 months.  
Seeing pro hunters getting critical bugs with automation and manual recon — and I’m here feeling stuck. 😞  
Why can’t I find anything? Why can’t I automate like them?

> **Should I focus on APIs or OWASP Web? Should I learn recon/automation first or manual? I’m stuck in this loop hell.** 😵‍💫

## 🧩 **Other Tasks**

- ✅ Completed a room on TryHackMe  
- ❌ No HTB today
