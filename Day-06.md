# **Day 6 of My Bug Bounty Journey**
---

**السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته** ✨

---

**It's Monday and a college day! I went to college and attended classes from 9 AM to 4 PM.**

### ***Bug Bounty Update***
- Studied a few writeups.  
- Read a few pages of the **Black Hat GraphQL** book.  
- Couldn't do much else due to lack of time — need to manage exams as my end-semester exams are starting soon.

### ***Other Tasks***
- A few days ago, I installed **HTB x Parrot OS** (I love trying different OSes just for exploration). Today, I solved an easy-level machine on it.  
- Completed a few more tasks of **Linux PrivEsc** on **THM**.  
- Watched a few lectures on **JavaScript**.
