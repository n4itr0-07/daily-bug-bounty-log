- Read a few pages of **Black Hat GraphQL** 📖
- Watched a lecture on GraphQL by [Piyush Garg ~ YouTube](https://youtu.be/WtkKwO1viI8?si=kknWszz7r3aJ4FLy) 🎥
- Recon from scratch on same target. This target is using GraphQL i don't know for which bug i should look for. Which request i should send in repeater i am confused. 🥲
- Read a few H1 reports and Medium writeups.
- Learned gathering subdomains from crt.sh, virustotal.com, netcraft.com, etc. 🕵️‍♂️
