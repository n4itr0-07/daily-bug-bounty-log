# **Day 2 of My Bug Bounty Journey**
---

**السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته**

Once again, I didn’t attend classes today 😥. Honestly, I feel like I waste my time in college, so it’s better to stay home and be productive.

## 🔧 Technical Progress

Started my day with **HackTheBox** — completed the **Networking Fundamentals** module!  
> I’ll start solving HTB machines soon, Insha’Allah 💪

- Learned about **Subnetting** and **IP addresses**  
- Watched 2–3 lectures and solved a few questions 📚  
- Plan to revise everything tomorrow 🧠

🎥 Also watched a new video by **NahamSec** (uploaded just 2 days ago):  
[**The No BS Bug Bounty & Web Hacking Roadmap**](https://youtu.be/AMQq06WUMVk?si=yiVtoTQKMQunlpJr) 🫡 — **Highly recommended!**

👾 Solved a few challenges on **TryHackMe** as well.

## 🐞 Bug Hunt Time

Continued with **recon** today 🔍  
- Collected more subdomains and filtered the active ones  
- My target seems to be using **GraphQL** — should I start learning it now? What’s your opinion? 🤔

### ⚠️ Tool Troubles
- Tried using **GAU**, but it’s not working on my VPS 😤  
- Also used **Katana**, but it’s acting up too  
- Tools are giving me a headache — maybe I should switch to a **manual approach** for now  

Despite this, I gathered a decent number of subdomains and JavaScript files. But as a beginner, I’m a bit **lost** about what to do next 😓

- Found a JS file pointing to a **GraphQL Admin Login page**  
- It’s just a plain login page... and I have no idea what to do now 🫠  
- Spent about **4 hours** on recon today — the subdomains are weird and confusing 🥲

## 🎓 College Study Update

Still didn’t study today 🙃  
I need to catch up on:
- **Discrete Mathematics**
- **DBMS**
- **Python**
- **Linux/UNIX Syllabus**

I’ve been skipping classes too, so I’ve got a lot to cover.  
> Insha’Allah, I’ll dedicate some time to my studies starting tomorrow 📖

## 🧩 Other Tasks

- Practicing on **Monkeytype** for the past 2 weeks to improve my typing speed — still stuck at **40–45 WPM** 😅  
- Tried **Duolingo** to learn **Arabic**, but it only teaches random words that don’t make much sense.  
  If you know a better way to learn Arabic, please let me know 🙏

> I’m not perfect — just trying to get better day by day.  
> I’m a **beginner**, not a pro — just a student learning from everyone 🤝
